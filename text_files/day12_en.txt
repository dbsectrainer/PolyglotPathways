Idiomatic Expressions for Natural Fluency
-----------------------------------------
It's not my cup of tea
That's the last straw
Let's bury the hatchet
Speak of the devil
It's a piece of cake
The ball is in your court
It's not rocket science
I'm all ears
Let's get the ball rolling
Don't cry over spilled milk

Advanced Storytelling Techniques
--------------------------------
I have an incredible story for you
You won't believe what happened
The strangest thing happened
And that was just the beginning…
I couldn't believe my eyes
What happened next changed everything
I was in the right place at the right time
I'll never forget that moment
Just when I thought it was over…
It was a lesson I'll always remember

Expressing Deep Emotions
------------------------
I don't know how to put it into words
My heart is full of gratitude
This means the world to me
I feel completely overwhelmed
I've never felt this way before
I feel torn between two choices
I can't express how much this means
I wish I had the right words to say
It's a feeling I can't describe
My emotions are all over the place

Handling Difficult Conversations with Fluency
---------------------------------------------
I don't want to argue
Let's find a solution together
I understand your point of view
Can we talk about this calmly?
I respect your opinion, but I disagree
Let's take a break and come back to this later
I don't want any misunderstandings
Let's be honest with each other
It's important to communicate openly
Can we meet halfway?

Speaking More Like a Native
---------------------------
Let me put it this way
That's not what I meant
You know what I mean?
I was about to say the same thing
That's exactly what I was thinking
I couldn't have said it better
You took the words right out of my mouth
I completely lost my train of thought
It's on the tip of my tongue
Let's just go with the flow

Asking Deeper Questions to Keep Conversations Going
---------------------------------------------------
What's the best advice you've ever received?
If you could change one thing about the world, what would it be?
What motivates you every day?
What's something you're passionate about?
If you could live anywhere, where would it be?
What's a challenge that made you stronger?
What's your biggest dream?
What's the best decision you've ever made?
If you could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, who would it be?
What do you think is the key to happiness?
